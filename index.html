            <header><h3>Cesario Ramos - Crafting an Agile framework that is uniquely yours</h3></header>
            <p>This talk invites you to explore the possibilities beyond the rigid and predefined frameworks. Discover how using axioms, principles, 
                and guidelines can guide you to develop an Agile framework that fits with the unique dynamics of your organization. 
            While Agile frameworks offer a foundational 'safety net' with well-defined rules, processes, and established roles to mitigate 
                organizational design pitfalls, the challenge lies in navigating the number of options to find the perfect match. Yes, the better frameworks 
                leave a lot of room to fill in the details and tailor it to your situation. But then the questions is: How to fill in the details?

            In this session, we will guide you through the journey of abandoning the one-size-fits-all approach. By focusing on your specific context and employing 
                a set of foundational axioms, principles, and guidelines, you can evolve a framework that not only addresses your unique challenges but also enhances 
                your team's agility and effectiveness.</p>

            <header><h3>Martin Christensen - Holistic Product Discovery</h3></header>
            <p>One of the biggest problems with product development is that a great deal of what is built does not reach the intended impact. 
                The most obvious reason for this is that one rarely focuses on building a product / service that meets the business goals, 
                benefits from the technology AND provides a desired user experience at the same time. Let’s take a look at a possible 
                approach to solve this called Continuous Collaborative Discovery & Delivery, or just Holistic Product Discovery for short. </p>

            <p>The legacy of the original lightweight and barely sufficient Agile ideas (XP and Scrum) has been impeded by the difficulties of applying them beyond a single team without losing the key principles and the promised gains.</p>
            <p>Over the last decade, that challenge has led to a rise in heavy- weight methods, especially SAFe™, which has become a go-to place for "everything agile". It provides the user with a profound variety of specific tools and techniques for "scaling agile”.</p>
            <p>Org Topologies™ is a framework-agnostic approach that builds upon whatever you already have implemented. It will allow you to further develop your Agile ecosystems witha vector toward an org design where business and technology work as one to create true business agility.</p>
            <p>Attendees will learn the language of Org Topologies™. They will acquire clarity on which organization ecosystem they want to build and which behaviors they expect it to exhibit.</p>

            <header><h3>James Priest - Reclaiming the power of argumentation to connect and enlighten a divided world.</h3></header>
                <p>Eliminating unnecessary dependencies in organizations empowers individuals to decide and act for themselves. Doing so reduces waste, enhances productivity, and fosters a greater sense of ownership and responsibility. At the same time, when deciding how to deal with complex issues and unavoidable dependencies, involving stakeholders and others with a broad scope of knowledge and expertise is often essential for arriving at a good enough decision.</p>
                <p>However, collaborative decision-making can be challenging. Disagreements are common, and failure to navigate them effectively can lead to ongoing conflict or people becoming unreasonable or disengaged.
                </p>
                <p>Yet, any disagreement is a symptom of new information seeking emergence. Examining the reasons behind disputes will always reveal something valuable—whether a misunderstanding, a worthwhile improvement, or a way to avoid undesirable consequences or risks. In a world where we are simply not smart enough to navigate complexity alone, learning to harness the power of dissent and argumentation, being open to reason, and developing a nuanced point of view are crucial for building effective and resilient organizations and for dealing with many of the challenges we face in the world today.
                </p>
                <p>This talk examines the unfortunate consequences of unresolved disagreements, why handling them can be so tricky, and lays out how to approach decision-making to bridge divides and maximize the chances of success.</p>

                <h4>Building Perfect Bridges through Collaboration</h4>
            </header>
            <p>Everyone agrees that it is important to collaborate in an organisation, within a team, between teams, and between individuals. But rarely, there are good advice on how to do it. This one-day-workshop aims at creating great collaborators out of the participants by supplying them with the missing pieces of the collaboration puzzle.</p>
            <span id="more-martin-workshop" style="display: none">
                <p>The workshop starts with a simulation, showing several different ways of collaborating, because as with so many other things, collaboration is not something that is just on or off. Some forms feel really efficient, some are actually really efficient and some also give the right outcome. And, not to forget, some forms of collaboration fit some people. Understanding where the participant fits and what their ambitions are sets the base for how the collaboration might be improved. Methods, both on macro- (organisational/process) and micro-level (individual/technique) are explored to find ways of working fitting the participant’s context and predisposition. The participant will leave the workshop with a realistic plan for improving their collaboration as well as a way of thinking that will make them competent in helping others to improve, becoming the perfect bridge builders.</p>

                <p>One participant (among many) said that this workshop has given her a language around collaboration that helped her connect to other people on a higher level and together actually build something really valuable.</p>

                <p>This workshop is for everyone who works with other people. The examples are mainly from IT but the methods, principles and models are generic. No prerequisites needed.</p>

                <h4>Mastering Difficult Conversations</h4>
                <h5>Essential communication skills to transform potential conflicts into mutually beneficial opportunities to learn and grow</h5>
            </header>
            <p>Do you ever hesitate to initiate a conversation because you fear it might lead to conflict or ‘bad’ feelings?</p>
            <p>Have you ever spoken up about something, and things didn’t go as well as you’d hoped?</p> 
            <p>Have you ever received feedback, a grievance, or a disagreement and felt uncertain about how to respond?</p>

            <span id="more-james-workshop" style="display: none">
                <p>Having potentially ‘difficult conversations’ is an inevitable aspect of professional (and personal) life. However, everyone is tempted to avoid them sometimes for fear of negative consequences. Even with the best intentions, such conversations can quickly escalate from bad to worse. </p>
                <p>Every ‘difficult conversation’ holds the potential to build and maintain more authentic and productive relationships. The key to unlocking this potential lies in learning how to send and receive messages to maximize the likelihood of successful communication.</p>
                <p>During this experiential workshop, you will learn several practical strategies and techniques that will enhance your ability to:
                <ol>
                    <li>Initiate and conduct difficult conversations in ways that ensure your intended message is likely to be received and considered positively.</li>
                    <li>Respond constructively to complaints, criticism, and grievances, no matter how they are delivered.</li>
                </ol>
                This workshop is for you if you want to elevate your communication skills to the next level and navigate potentially sensitive conversations with confidence and grace.</p>
                <p><strong>James and Lili</strong> are co-developers of Sociocracy 3.0 and work internationally, supporting people in organizations to improve agility and performance. With extensive experience helping people learn how to better help themselves, they’re looking forward to sharing their deep understanding of relational dynamics and practical strategies for enhancing communication, with you!</p>
