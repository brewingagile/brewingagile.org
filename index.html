            <p>To be successful in your Agile transformation it is important to know where your organisation is and what might be a next step forward. In our book "Scrum Patterns” we collected Scrum Patterns from all over the world and wrote them down for you to use to improve your organisation.</p>
            <p>In this talk I will share the story of the Scrum Patterns, and how you can use them to build your team, build your product organisation and scale your Scrum.</p>

            <header><h3>Agile as If You Meant It</h3></header>
            <p>For over a decade of software product agile, we have been inspecting and adapting the way we work. We have come to appreciate software development as a process where we turn ideas into code where true ownership of progress lies within the developers working in devops style. Users see no change unless a developer implements a change. While we center the developers, every developer welcomes help in understanding what is the right thing to build and how we together could learn about it more effectively.</p>
            <p>In this talk, we look at a case example of what Modern Agile looks like with F-Secure Corporate Windows security endpoint development. Building on practices of internal open source valuing contributions towards changing the code, we grow people to work within a wider role of a developer. We focus on pull on scheduling and information, run dual track of discovery and delivery, organize work around submitting to identified bottlenecks, grow people and take things further on developer-centric ways of working having no scrum masters or product owners. </p>
            <p>Customer-focused team directly in touch with their customers performs better without a proxy. Join me to learn how the decision power shared for everyone in the team transformed the ability to deliver, and how collaboration is organized when users are counted in the millions and the contributors to the product in hundreds.</p>

            <h5>Experience the shift in leadership that is required for Agile teams</h5>
            <p>Did you ever try to install the latest version of Office365 to a computer that runs on Windows XP?</p>
            <p>Most people will know that this is a heroic quest that will probably lead to some disappointment.</p>
            <p>However, many organizations are trying to accomplish something similar with their Agile and Scrum implementation: they adopt a set of models, frameworks and practices on an operating system that is not ready for it.</p>
            <p>Most of the organizations do not even get half of the potential of the Agile teams, because they never considered that an update of their leadership model\operating system was a precondition to make those teams successful.</p>
            <p>In this session I will be using a number of interactive exercises and thought-provoking statements to deal with the following topics:</p>
            <p>How to update the operating system for the Agile Leader and what could be missing in the old one?</p>
            <p>What are the paradigm shifts we need to make as Leaders in order to make Agile succeed?</p>
            <p>What are the first steps that we can make as Leaders to make sure that we can create the most fertile soil for Agile teams to grow?</p>
            <p>What Organizational\Human Design Systems we are using to design a Learning Path for the Agile Leader?</p>
            <p>How do these Systems link to the context of an Agile team?</p>
            <p>How you can start using these ideas as a Leader in the Agile transformation?</p>
            <p>These exercises will trigger you to think more from the perspective from a more traditional leader who struggles with adopting the new Agile mindset.</p>

                <h3>Tuesday 3rd March, All Day</h3>
                <h4>Why should a Scrum team learn Kanban?</h4>
            </header>
            <p>Scrum is a fabulous way to organize a team to deliver value and quality consistently, and it is extremely flexible. Within a Sprint, a Scrum team can organize their collaboration in any way that helps to achieve the Sprint Goal. Kanban can provide the visibility, clarity, and flexibility that a team needs to do that, even in the face of new information or priorities.</p>
            <p>I was a Scrum Master on many Scrum teams for years before discovering Kanban. It addressed so many issues that I was having with reporting, predictability, overburdening, and delivering faster. It helped to establish trust with new clients early in the process by delivering working features earlier in a Sprint. It felt like Scrum's missing superpower.</p>
            <p>In this workshop, we'll teach you to improve visibility into your team's process so that everyone on the team can make better decisions, communicate and collaborate more effectively, and forecast more accurately. You'll learn to improve your retrospectives with metrics that make it easier to identify opportunities for improvement and to demonstrate which improvement decisions are effective.</p>
            <p>You could learn Kanban for Scrum from a Scrum trainer. But why not learn it from a seasoned Kanban professional, who also has a decade of experience managing Scrum teams?</p>

                <h4>Exploratory Testing</h4>
            </header>
            <p>Testing activities account for a significant portion of costs we invest into software development, and testing is done by all people participating in development, including specialized testers. The skill of delivering the right information effectively and efficiently through testing is the core of this course: exploratory testing frames the thinking about the system, and engulfs the idea of creating artifacts to support testing. </p>
            <p>In this work course, we work on building the good habits of skilled exploratory testing, layer by layer through creating a shared learning experience. We work on different types of testing tasks as a group: from analyzing a user interface to analysing an individual feature; from relying on requirements documentation to free associations; from focusing on coverage to focusing on understanding problems; from user interface to peeking at the code.</p>
            <p>You get to experience exploratory testing hands-on and learn by doing: we plan testing, tests and run our tests, and report bugs. We learn testing skills through testing in a group format. Our test target is an open-source editor tool that is easy to learn. We start with limited and defined functionalities, and learn essential thinking skills and approaches to manage one’s own testing work & scope. </p>
            <p>Join in to experience how exploratory testing is different from traditional testing, and collect practical ideas to amplify your testing. With exploratory testing, we make best possible use of our limited time with intelligent testing that delivers results! </p>
