            <p>Remote working existed before covid, but covid made it more widespread. With extensive polling of workers worldwide, the answer is clear: the future of work is choice. For organizations to survive and thrive in the modern world, we want to be able to work in a “remote first” way: working online as if we were in the office together.</p>
            <p>In this interactive presentation, tailored for developers who may think, "We've been working remotely for years now; what else is there to learn?" we'll dive deeper into the nuances of remote work and explore innovative strategies for seamless collaboration at a distance. We'll go beyond the basics and delve into advanced techniques digital nomads, virtual entrepreneurs, and global organizations use to foster a truly connected remote workforce.</p>
            <span style="display: none">
                <p>Here is an outline of topics covered:</p>

            <p>Gunther Verheyen, independent Scrum Caretaker, observes how Scrum is adopted widely and massively around the world. Although the global communities of Scrum practitioners have achieved a lot, Gunther feels that many Scrum adoptions, and therefore Scrum itself have ended up in a status-quo anyhow. Without people questioning or challenging this situation deeply. If Scrum Masters have stopped challenging the status-quo, who else is helping and inspiring our organizations to shift from the industrial (Taylorist) ways to the Agile paradigm?</p>
            <p>The closing quote of Gunther's book “Scrum - A Pocket Guide” is "The future state of Scrum will no longer be called ‘Scrum’. What we now call Scrum will have become the norm, and organizations have re-emerged around it.” Building on this quote, Gunther shares his view on why it is important to move (your) Scrum downfield and what tactics are to do so.</p>

            <header><h3>Putting the flow back into workflows</h3></header>
            <p>A workflow is a process in which work moves through as it is completed – at least, that's what the name suggests. Based on my experience working with and talking to teams, workflows don't always facilitate flow. Instead, they are often built to function as ways to keep everyone at 100% capacity and/or act as mazes with many places where you can get lost for quite some time. The problem is that's usually not the intent.</p>
            <p>In this session, you'll get a refresher on the point of workflows in general, learn some tips on a better mindset to use when building them, and get advice on avoiding creating workflows that get in the way of, rather than facilitate, flow.</p>

                <h4>The Scrum Values (module 1)</h4><!--<h5>[SPC-VX1]</h5>-->
            </header>
            <p><b>Gunther stated in his book <i>Scrum - A Pocket Guide:</i> “Scrum is more about behavior than it is about process”. Gunther developed the Scrum Pocket Class about <i>The Scrum Values</i> to explore how its five core values offer a richer view on Scrum: commitment, focus, openness, respect and courage. Because Scrum is a framework of rules, principles and...values. And values drive behavior.</b></p>
            <span id="more-gunther-workshop1" style="display: none">
                <p>Scrum’s DNA consists of empiricism and self-organization. These ‘strings’ represent respectively the ‘process’ and the ‘people’ aspect of Scrum. The empirical process as implemented by Scrum is increasingly replacing the old, traditional predictive management approach. What is more difficult to grasp is that the benefits realized through Scrum largely depend not on the rules, but on the interactions and collaboration of the people employing Scrum. Shifting the balance towards the people aspect of Scrum and therefore restoring the people-process balance is one of the major future challenges for the Scrum movement.</p>
                <p>At the heart of Gunther’s view is that Scrum, actually, is <i>more about behavior</i> than it is about process. Values drive behavior. Scrum thrives on five values: commitment, focus, openness, respect and courage. As behavior also mirrors underlying values, Scrum is also expressed through these values. The Scrum Values are the compass to as well as the barometer of a Scrum adoption.</p>
                <p>Although these values were not invented as a part of Scrum, and are not exclusive to Scrum, they do give direction to the work, behavior and actions in Scrum. In a Scrum context, our decisions, the steps we take, the way we play the game, the practices we include and the activities we undertake within Scrum should all re-enforce these values, not diminish or undermine them. That however requires understanding these values, and the associated behaviors, in a context of...Scrum, which means to understand them against the background of the combination of people+complexity+empiricism.</p>
                <p>Gunther does not aspire preaching or even teaching values. In this interactive workshop, he collaboratively invites people to look at the Scrum framework through the lens of <b>the Scrum Values</b> in a context of Scrum. Gunther helps participants grasp how the Scrum Values can help them look beyond the rules of Scrum and enrich their view on the Scrum framework.</p>

                <h4>Scrum in the Large (module 1)</h4><!--<h5>[SPC-XL1]</h5>-->
            </header>
            <p><b>Gunther developed the Scrum Pocket Class about <i>Scrum in the Large</i> to explore how even in the large it is possible to keep the rules of the game intact. The participants explore how the rules are independent of the scale at which Scrum is organized. It is a first step to help people and organizations re-think their structures around Scrum and upgrade their organization accordingly.</b></p>
            <span id="more-gunther-workshop2" style="display: none">
                <p>Scrum’s DNA is empiricism and self-organization and Scrum promotes simplicity, clear accountability and peer collaboration to deal with unpredictability and formulate answers to complex problems. These foundational aspects of Scrum were not at the core of many enterprises when enlarging their organizational and work structures. The main challenge of many organizations wanting to apply Scrum in the large lies not in fitting Scrum into the existing structures, although this is what typically happens. The real challenge is to revise the existing structures via a bottom-up understanding, implementation and growth of Scrum. Because “Scrum is only used effectively if organizations re-think the structures around it”.</p>
                <p>At the heart of Gunther’s view on Scrum ‘in the large’ is the gradual transformation of an organization towards a networked structure of what he calls ‘Product Hubs’. A Product Hub is a mini-organization acting as a start-up within the overarching organization. It is optimally organized for a product (not for functional specializations) as ‘product’ is the vehicle to deliver value. Because such a product (or service) is managed with Scrum, in this first module of the SPC <b>Scrum in the Large</b> the focus is on “Multi-team Scrum”, and what is needed to get there. Without any additional scaling frameworks. Just...Scrum.</p>
                <p>Gunther does not aspire teaching how to scale Scrum or introduce a new scaling framework. In this interactive workshop, he collaboratively explores with the participants the principles that apply when the need arises to maintain a product with more people than can conveniently work as one team,
                    i.e. move to a “Multi-Team Scrum” setup. Gunther helps the participants grasp how the rules of the Scrum framework don’t change and why no additions are needed when having to work with multiple teams (on the same product).</p>

            <p>
                A workflow is a process in which work moves through as it is completed.
                However, in most teams I've worked with, the workflow doesn't really help facilitate flow.
                Instead, they end up as mazes with many places where you can <em>get lost for quite some time</em>,
                or it leads to making sure everyone is <em>working at 100% capacity</em>.
                This drives behaviours and insights that are damaging to the people, work and company.
